LLM-Based Test Generation Framework for Relational Databases
Relational databases power critical systems in domains like finance, healthcare, and e-commerce. While they are optimized for performance, even minor changes or enhancements can introduce subtle bugs that impact accuracy, security, or privacy.
This project aims to leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate the generation of realistic test data and intelligent SQL test queries. Beyond crash testing, the tool will validate whether query results are logically correct. This shifts testing from mere survival to correctness assurance.
